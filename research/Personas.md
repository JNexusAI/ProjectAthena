* **Role:** Senior Account Executive, 5 years of experience. Manages a portfolio of 20 high-value enterprise accounts.
* **Bio:** Alex is a highly motivated and relationship-driven seller. He's tech-savvy but impatient with tools that slow him down. He lives and breathes his sales targets and prides himself on being a trusted advisor to his clients, which requires deep preparation before every call.
* **Goals:**
    * Exceed his quarterly sales quota.
    * Spend more time building relationships and less time on administrative tasks.
    * Have all the relevant information at his fingertips to be hyper-prepared for client meetings.
* **Frustrations:**
    * "I waste so much time digging through old emails and call notes just to get up to speed on an account."
    * "Updating the CRM after a long day of calls is the worst part of my job. I know I miss things, which makes our forecast inaccurate."
    * "It's embarrassing when a client brings up a past support issue that I didn't know about."
* **Quote:** *"Just tell me what I need to know, when I need to know it, so I can get back to selling."*

* **Role:** Manager of a team of 8 Account Executives. Responsible for the team's overall performance and forecast accuracy.
* **Bio:** Maria is a data-driven leader who was recently promoted from a top-performing AE role. She is responsible for coaching her team, identifying risks in the pipeline, and reporting an accurate forecast to leadership. She trusts her team but needs reliable data to do her job effectively.
* **Goals:**
    * Ensure her team hits its collective sales target.
    * Maintain an accurate and predictable sales forecast.
    * Spend coaching time on deal strategy, not on nagging her reps to update the CRM.
* **Frustrations:**
    * "I can't trust the forecast because I know the data in the CRM is stale or incomplete."
    * "My one-on-ones get derailed by having to ask basic questions about deal status instead of focusing on strategy."
    * "I have no easy way to spot a deal that's losing momentum until it's too late."
* **Quote:** *"I have the talent on my team; I just need the data to be clean so I can guide them effectively."*
