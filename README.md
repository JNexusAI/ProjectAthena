# ProjectAthena
A product case study on developing an enterprise AI copilot to automate sales workflows and increase CRM adoption.
Athena is an AI copilot designed to transform the daily grind of CRM into a strategic advantage. It eliminates administrative busywork and empowers sales teams with the proactive intelligence they need to close deals faster.

The Challenge: The CRM Productivity Paradox
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms are the heart of any sales organization, yet they often become a major source of frustration and inefficiency. From my research and experience, I identified a core set of problems:

Administrative Overload: Sales reps lose nearly a full day every week (~8-10 hours) to manual data entry, logging calls, and updating opportunities. This is time they could be spending with customers.

Lost Insights: Critical information is buried across thousands of emails, call notes, and support tickets. This "tribal knowledge" rarely makes it into the CRM in a structured way, leading to missed opportunities and poor forecasting.

Low Adoption: Because the CRM is seen as a tool for management rather than a tool for sellers, feature adoption is low, and data quality suffers, creating a vicious cycle.

Our Vision: From System of Record to System of Intelligence
My vision for Athena was to fundamentally change the user's relationship with their CRM. Instead of a passive database that requires constant manual feeding, Athena turns the CRM into a proactive partner that works for the seller.

We would achieve this by delivering a product that is:

Automated: Drastically reduce manual data entry.

Intelligent: Surface the right information at the right time.

Conversational: Allow users to interact with their data naturally.

The Solution: A Phased Approach to Intelligence üß†
Athena is designed on a strategic, three-phase roadmap, ensuring we build user trust and deliver value at every step.

The Reactive Assistant: Users can ask questions in natural language ("Summarize my last call with Acme Corp") and generate content ("Draft a follow-up email").

The Proactive Nudge: Athena automatically provides insights the user isn't even looking for, like generating a full meeting briefing before a client call.

The Autonomous Agent: With user approval, Athena takes action, such as automatically updating the deal stage in the CRM based on the content of a sales call.
